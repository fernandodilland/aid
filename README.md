## Introduction

Welcome to AID. Our project seeks to redefine the concept of a secure digital identity by improving any security protocol implemented in the past, a unique and unclonable digital identity stored on blockchain and connected to a subdermal chip for identity validation in any circumstance that is required, whether in the network or in the real world.

Our goal is to provide the user with the ease of validating their identity with the use of a chip in any circumstance from registering on a website, identifying themselves at an airport, or accessing their home, among other functionalities. Leaving paper IDs behind by creating certified digital copies and eliminating any type of identity theft. Saving all that information on blockchain with unique access to the owner of the information.
